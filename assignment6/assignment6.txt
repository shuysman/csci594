For this week's assignment, run a distributed version of a naturally parallel problem on Tempest, observing the behavior when scaling the workloads across greater resources. 

    Create a folder named output in your home folder on Tempest
    Copy the scripts from /home/group/assignment6/ to your home folder on Tempest as a starting point
    Modify them to run a different naturally parallel problem and summarize the results
        If you can, select a problem that is relevant to your field of study or research â€“ if you are unable to find a relevant naturally parallel problem, you man instead select some other naturally parallel problem
    Copy the array sbatch script to your output folder
    Cd to your output folder and submit the array job
    Cd to your home folder, modify summarize.sbatch with the proper jobid, and run the summarize job
    Submit your slurm array sbatch script, summarize sbatch script, and your final output to D2L
